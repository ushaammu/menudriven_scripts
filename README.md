# menudriven_scripts  using switchcase
This script is a simple menu-driven Bash program that allows the user to choose an operation from a list of options. It uses the case…esac statement (similar to switch-case in other programming languages) to perform different tasks based on the user’s input. After displaying a menu with choices such as creating a file, creating a directory, listing files, or showing an invalid option, the script reads the user’s selection and executes the corresponding block of code. Each case block contains specific commands—like touch for file creation, mkdir for directory creation, or ls -lat for listing files. If the user enters a value outside the valid range (1–4), the default case prints a message instructing them to enter a valid choice. This design makes the script interactive, user-friendly, and easy to extend with additional menu option
